1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    In server side router, the browser sends a request to the server, and the server send a response for the browser to render. This is faster to load the application, because only the necessary data is loaded at a time. It is slower per page load however, and the page has to refresh every time a response is sent.

    In client side routing, the browser loads the entire application at once, and the browser takes care of rendering the required information. This can be slower to load the whole application, but each page loads faster and doesn't have to refresh.
